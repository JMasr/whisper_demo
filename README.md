# About
The demo focuses on fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model to improve its performance for Galician transcription tasks. Whisper is a powerful ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model, and this project customizes it to accurately transcribe spoken Galician by enhancing the model's language-specific capabilities.
